# CS305-Software-Security

<b> Who was the client and what issue did they want to address? </b>

Artemis Financial is a fictional consulting company that creates financial plans for their clients. They wanted to include a file verification step to their application in the form of a checksum verification and to have secure communications between the client and the server. Their requirements for this were to implement an algorithm cipher into the code by writing a @RequestMapping method, confirm functionality by performing a checksum verification, generate a self-signed certificate using the command prompt, refactor the code base to convert from HTTP tto HTTPS protocol, perform secondary testing with dependency cheks, and perform functional testing by manually reviewing the code.
